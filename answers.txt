Q1: Why might be consider using git?

Answer: It is very good with version control, meaning there is a lot of flexibility with different 
sets of files/code being implemented together with room for error and going back to previous repo 
versions when needed. Additionally, with group work it is very useful for organization and aditional 
version control to sync different work together without major issues.
